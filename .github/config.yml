  💖 Thanks for opening this pull request! 💖

  We use [semantic commit messages](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) to streamline the release process. Before your pull request can be merged, you should **update your pull request title** to start with a semantic prefix.

  Examples of commit messages with semantic prefixes:

  - `fix: don't overwrite prevent_default if default wasn't prevented`
  - `feat: add app.isPackaged() method`
  - `docs: app.isDefaultProtocolClient is now available on Linux`

  Things that will help get your PR across the finish line:

  - Follow the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) coding style
  - Document any user-facing changes you've made following the [documentation styleguide](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/styleguide.md).
  - Include tests when adding/changing behavior.
  - Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible.
